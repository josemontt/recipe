Chilean Cazuela Recipe

Ingredients
1 lb. beef brisket
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, cut into quarters
1 bell pepper or other sweet pepper, cut into quarters with the seeds removed
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper
One celery stalk
2 ears of corn, cut into thirds
2 carrots, peeled and cut into thirds
6 small red potatoes, peeled
4 handfuls of rice
6 small pieces of pumpkin
1 handful of green beans, julienned
5-6 cups boiling water

Instructions
Step 1
First cut the meat into six portions. Then pre-heat the vegetable oil in a large pot. Braise the meat for three minutes on each side, and add the onion, seasonings, salt and pepper. Mix well and cook for five minutes.
Step 2
When ready, place the potatoes, carrots, celery and pumpkin in the pot. Completely cover the contents with boiling water-about five or six cups and cook for ten minutes. Next incorporate the rice and corn; let simmer for eight minutes. Finally, mix-in the green beans and cook for three more minutes.
Step 3
Sample the stew and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Serve hot with one piece of meat, one potato, one piece of pumpkin and a portion of corn in each dish of stew.
Step 4
To garnish, sprinkle a little cilantro over each serving.
